                <h1>Systems Performance vs Web Performance: Understanding the Distinction</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Performance optimization can mean different things to different teams. A frontend developer's idea of performance might focus on page load times, while a systems engineer thinks about CPU utilization and throughput. It's good to understand the difference between web performance and systems performance, as they represent different scopes and approaches to how we achieve performance optimization.</p>

            <h2>Systems Performance: The Bigger Picture</h2>
            <p>Systems performance encompasses the entire computing environment - hardware, software, storage, and network components across distributed systems. It examines how these elements interact and influence overall performance. Key metrics include system-wide latency, throughput, resource utilization, and operational costs.</p>

            <h2>Web Performance: The User Experience Focus</h2>
            <p>“Web performance has always been an important aspect of creating a website—numerous studies have shown the negative impact of a poorly performing website. With every additional second your website takes to load or respond to interactions, visitors leave, sales are lost, and engagement goes down.” - Barry Pollard</p>
            <p>Web performance refers primarily to the speed at which a website loads. It primarily concerns browser-side optimization, content delivery, and user experience metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Time to First Byte (TTFB).</p>

            <h2>Key Differences</h2>
            <p>The key differences of systems vs web performance:</p>

            <h3>1. Scope</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Systems: Infrastructure and complete data path</li>
              <li>Web: Browser-server interaction and content rendering</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Optimization Targets</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Systems: Resource efficiency, cost reduction</li> 
              <li>Web: Page load speed, user interaction smoothness</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Tools and Solutions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Systems: Infrastructure upgrades, capacity planning</li>
              <li>Web: CDNs, frontend optimization, caching</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Stakeholders</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Systems: Operations teams, administrators</li>
              <li>Web: Frontend developers, UX designers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Understanding these distinctions helps teams better target their optimization efforts and communicate more precisely about performance goals.</p>
